                        HOW EFFECTIVE ARE MASKS AND DO THEY ALSO NEED TO COVER MY NOSE?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        Masks alone are not enough to fully protect someone from the virus, but they still have an essential role to play in protecting high risk individuals.<br>
                        Using a mask to just cover the mouth and not the nose only addresses part of risk, and so could defeat the whole purpose of wearing one in the first place

                <li>
                    <h3>
                        WHY DO GOVERNMENTS BENEFIT FROM HELPING TO ENSURE OTHER COUNTRIES ACCESS VACCINES?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        Ensuring COVID-19 vaccines reach people in the world’s poorest countries isn’t just about being charitable or acting on a moral imperative; it’s also in the best interest of every country to do so.<br>
                        Until every country has access to vaccines and they have been administered to a high enough proportion of the population to considerably reduce death and severe disease from COVID-19, commerce, international trade and tourism cannot resume

                        WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE HERD IMMUNITY WITHOUT VACCINES?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        Attempting to achieve natural herd immunity through infection will lead to a rise in cases, and a surge in the number of deaths. Moreover, natural immunity to coronaviruses usually only lasts for up to a couple of years.

                        HOW CAN WE TRUST VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SO FAST?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and produced in record time, but it’s also involved unprecedented levels of funding and global cooperation to tackle a global threat. So far, all approved COVID-19 vaccines have undergone large clinical trials with rigorous safety protocols, and without major safety concerns raised.

                        IS REGULARLY WASHING MY HANDS ENOUGH TO PROTECT ME?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        Even though regularly washing your hands is very important, as with masks it is not enough on its own.<br>
                        Keep washing your hands for at least 20 seconds each time, keep carrying antibacterial gel when you’re travelling and remember to wear a mask and practice physical distancing.

                        CAN COVID-19 BE CAUGHT FROM A PERSON WHO HAS NO SYMPTOMS?
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory dropletsexpelled by someone who is coughing. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, justa mild cough and does not feel ill.

                    <h4>
                        Yes, it is advisable to receive complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with COVID-19.  Development of immunity or duration of protection after COVID-19 exposure is not established therefore it is recommended to receive vaccine even after COVID-19 infection. Wait for 4-8 weeks after recovery from COVID symptoms before getting the vaccine.
